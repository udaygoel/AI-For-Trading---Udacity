# AI-For-Trading-Udacity

This repository contains projects on Quantitative Trading and use of AI Algorithms in Trading applications. These projects were developed as part of the [Udacity Artificial Intelligence for Trading Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-for-trading--nd880). 



## Projects

You can view and launch the following projects:

- [Alpha Research and Factor Modelling - Multifactor Model](https://github.com/udaygoel/AI-For-Trading-Udacity/tree/master/Alpha%20Research%20and%20Factor%20Modelling%20-%20Multifactor%20Model)

  In this project, a statistical risk model is built using PCA. This model is used to build a portfolio along with 5 alpha factors. These factors are created and then evaluated using factor-weighted returns, quantile analysis, sharpe ratio, and turnover analysis. At the end of the project, the portfolio is optimized using the risk model and factors using multiple optimization formulations. For the dataset, the end of day is taken from Quotemedia and sector data from Sharadar.

- [NLP on Financial Statements](https://github.com/udaygoel/AI-For-Trading-Udacity/tree/master/NLP%20on%20Financial%20Statements)

  In this project, a NLP analysis is performed on 10-K financial statements to generate an alpha factor. For the dataset, the end of day prices are taken from Quotemedia and sentiment words for [Loughran-McDonald sentiment word lists](https://sraf.nd.edu/textual-analysis/resources/#LM%20Sentiment%20Word%20Lists).

- [Analyzing Stock Sentiment from Twits]()

  In this project, a deep learning model using Embedding and LSTM is built in PyTorch to classify the sentiment of messages from [StockTwits](https://stocktwits.com/), a social network for investors and traders. The model is able to predict if any particular message is positive or negative. From this, we are able to generate a signal of the public sentiment for various ticker symbols.
  
- [Enhanced Alpha using Random Forest](https://github.com/udaygoel/AI-For-Trading-Udacity/tree/master/Enhanced%20Alpha%20using%20Random%20Forest)

  In this project, Random Forest is used to combine multiple trading signals to create enhanced alpha. It solves the problem of overlapping samples to avoid overfitting. For the dataset, the end of day is taken from Quotemedia and sector data from Sharadar.

- [Backtesting and Portfolio Optimization]()

  In this project, a backtesting notebook is created to perform portfolio optimization that includes transaction costs and is implemented with computational efficiency in mind to allow for a reasonably fast backtest. The notebook also uses performance attribution to identify the major drivers of the portfolio's profit-and-loss (PnL). The project uses Barra data.
